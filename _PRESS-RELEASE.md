There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Mealy: a meal reservation app for people who love to eat together

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  The niche market is communities of neighbors who have meals together on a weekly basis, such as co-housing communities. They get a streamlined signup and notification system that reduces organization and work for individuals.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  
  User-cooks can post a meal they want to organize: the date, the menu and other information. User-eaters can sign up for meals.

  E-mails automatically go out to group list-serv when meal is created, and two days before the meal. 

  Users can indicate preferences (gluten-free, vegetarian) and plate sizes (full, half). They can see the price(s) of the meal

  User profiles and default preferences are saved.

  There's a payment system: a user-eater can pay by PayPal, or run up a tab which can be used by treasurer to bill the user.

  Cooks can see the budget, based on how many reservations have been made, for their meal.


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Communities should focus on cooking and eating, not the headache of sending out emails, summing up budgets, and billing eaters.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Mealy handles the emails, the budget for the meal, and has a billing system. It stores user preferences making reservation a breeze.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "Let's focus on cooking and eating, not busywork that computers can do!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  "Just go on the website and click a button to post a meal, or click a different button to sign up for a meal!"

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Mealy saves me hours of time every week, and has made the whole community meal experience a lot more enjoyable for me and everyone I know!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  "Go to the website and try it out!"
